# For example, write out pseudo-code (both casual and formal) that does the following:

# a method that returns the sum of two integers
# a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings 
#   concatenated together
# a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element


# method 1

# START 
# SET variable 1 to integer 1
# SET variable 2 to integer 2
# PRINT integer_1 + integer_2 
# END

# method 2

# START 
# SET variable to array 
# variable.join
# END

# method 3
# START
# SET variable to array
# a = %w{ a b c d e f }
# a.length
# a.collect.with_index {|x, i| x(x+2) <= i}
